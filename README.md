# Echo Extension Template

This is a template for creating an Echo extension. It includes a basic structure for the extension,
so you do not have to start from scratch.

## Getting Started

### 1. you can clone this repository.
Clone this repository and name it as you want.

### 2. Configure the [gradle.properties](gradle.properties)
The file will have the following properties:
- `extType` - The type of the extension you want to create. It can be `music`, `tracker`
  or `lyrics`. More information can be found
  in [`Extension<*>`](https://github.com/brahmkshatriya/echo/blob/main/common/src/main/java/dev/brahmkshatriya/echo/common/Extension.kt#L33-L43)
  java doc.
- `extId` - The id of the extension. (Do not use spaces or special characters)
- `extClass` - The class of the extension. This should be the class that you inherit client
  interfaces to. For example in this template, it
  is [`TestExtension`](ext/src/main/java/dev/brahmkshatriya/echo/extension/TestExtension.kt).
- `extIcon` - (Optional) The icon of the extension. Will be cropped into a circle.
- `extName` - The name of the extension.
- `extDescription` - The description of the extension.
- `extAuthor` - The author of the extension.
- `extAuthorUrl` - (Optional) The author's website.
- `extRepoUrl` - (Optional) The repository URL of the extension.
- `extUpdateUrl` - (Optional) The update URL of the extension. The following urls are supported:
    - Github : https://api.github.com/repos/your_username/your_extension_repo/releases

### 3. Implement the extension
Here's where the fun begins. Echo checks for `Client` interfaces that your extension implemented to know if your extension supports the feature or not.

- What are `Client` interfaces?
  - These are interfaces that include functions your extension need to implement (`override fun`).
  - For example, if you want to create a lyrics extension, you need to implement the `LyricsClient` interface.
- What interfaces are available?
  - By default, the [`TestExtension`](ext/src/main/java/dev/brahmkshatriya/echo/extension/TestExtension.kt) implements the `ExtensionClient` interface.
  - Pro tip: Hover over the interface to see the documentation, Click on every one things that is clickable to dive deep into the rabbit hole.
  - You can find all the available interfaces, for:
      - Music Extension - [here](https://github.com/brahmkshatriya/echo/blob/main/common/src/main/java/dev/brahmkshatriya/echo/common/Extension.kt#L65-L117)
      - Tracker Extension - [here](https://github.com/brahmkshatriya/echo/blob/main/common/src/main/java/dev/brahmkshatriya/echo/common/Extension.kt#L123-L137)
      - Lyrics Extension - [here](https://github.com/brahmkshatriya/echo/blob/main/common/src/main/java/dev/brahmkshatriya/echo/common/Extension.kt#L143-L156)

The best example of how to implement an extension should be the [Spotify Extension](https://github.com/brahmkshatriya/echo-spotify-extension/blob/main/ext/src/main/java/dev/brahmkshatriya/echo/extension/SpotifyExtension.kt).

### 4. Testing the extension
There are two ways to test the extension:
- **Local testing**: You can test the extension locally by running the tests in the [`ExtensionUnitTest`](ext/src/test/java/dev/brahmkshatriya/echo/extension/ExtensionUnitTest.kt) class.
- **App testing**: You can test the extension in the Echo app by building & installing the `app` & then opening Echo app.

### 5. Publishing the extension
This template includes a GitHub Actions workflow that will automatically build and publish the extension to GitHub releases when you make a new commit. You can find the workflow file [here](.github/workflows/build.yml).
You need to do the following steps to publish the extension:
- Enable `Read & write permissions` for workflows in the repository settings (Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow Permissions).
- Generate a keystore file : https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key
- Add action secrets in the repository settings (Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret):
    - `KEYSTORE_B64` - The base64 encoded keystore file. [How to](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70396534)
    - `PASSWORD` - The password of the keystore file.
